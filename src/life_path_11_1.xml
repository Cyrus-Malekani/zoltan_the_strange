the path of sensitivitybeing born on the 2 life path means that you came into this lifetime to learn about feminine energy, relationships, equality, self-awareness, diplomacy, intuition, patience, healing, cooperation, peace, courtesy, and the importance of detail. in the 2000s, we have embarked on a new cycle of time in which the power of the feminine 2 energy predominates.  but the energy of 2 does not seek to control, but to achieve balance.  those born on the 2 life path have the potential to lead the way for humanity through their refined powers of persuasion, their ability to inspire on an emotional level, and most importantly, their desire to bring equality and peace to this planet. “the destination of mankind is to become more and more humane. ” ~albert schweitzerthe way in which 2 will lead is going to be very different from what we previously understood “leadership” to be.  for some, the transition between the masculine 1000s and the feminine 2000s may seem too slow, but, in the 2000s, in order to lead successfully, you must develop a calm and gracious approach that is based on reality rather than outdated ideology.  yours is the all important task of connection.  you must be able to see how the big picture is influenced by seemingly minor details, and yes, this will take time, dedication, and great patience. you are the one who encourages and promotes those who have something valuable to offer.  you are the one who takes care of the details that others are unable or unwilling to handle.  this makes you the ultimate networker – or agent – who provides a service which enables others to progress.  you are the indispensable behind-the-scenes organizer on whom others rely, and you will be given much opportunity to fulfill your own ambitions and dreams along the way. the way you live your life, feel your feelings, think your thoughts, make your decisions, and reach for your dreams, may be quite unusual.  it is from your example that others can learn, emulate, and embrace a brand new way of living which makes peace, love, and understanding their top priorities.  but it is important to understand that your days of dreaming about a better life are over.  the days of actually creating those improvements are here! the 2 life path enables you to bring forward ideas which were once considered idealistic but are now recognized as the basis of a more peaceful world.  remain true to your feelings and have the courage to question so-called authority and tradition.  you must learn to do this without the use of force.  use your natural ability to persuade instead. there is a cleverness about the 2 energy which you must tap into.  it provides you with the intelligence to achieve your objectives without jeopardizing your security or reputation.  your sensitive nature provides you with strong intelligence.  if you are patient enough with the details, you will know how to create peace out of chaos.  you have the ability to feel, intuit, and sense your way through life.  you must become comfortable with this gift, or you could become overwhelmed by your own feelings and shut them down completely, rendering you cold and seemingly heartless.  your recognition of reality is what makes you so sensitive in the first place, but your acceptance of reality and your desire to change – rather than just camouflage painful realities – can place you in a position of power and great personal satisfaction. our misunderstanding of emotion has led us to deny our feelings – our true sensitivity – to an alarming degree.  most people have forgotten how to feel.  they do what they can to suppress any feelings that may arise.  on the 2 life path, your ability to feel is your primary resource.  if you cut yourself off from it, you cannot feel happiness.  you can not feel fully alive or aware.  no matter how reality makes you feel, your acceptance of reality is what makes you so intelligent, and it is the key to your success and happiness. 2s tend to gravitate toward extremes.  some are oversensitive, passive, and self depreciating, while others are aggressive, angry, controlling, judgmental, and even cruel.  2s often pendulate between extremes before balance is achieved.  these extremes are created by your various fears, which must be faced head-on.  only then will you know what needs to be feared and what does not.  there is an inherent shyness in most 2s.  but when you remain true to yourself and follow your feelings, your humility turns to radiance and dignity. 2 = relation.  your sense of self is often overshadowed by your need to interact with and understand other people and their situations.  2 teaches you to relate one thing to another so that meaningful connections can be made.  relatives play important roles, although you do not believe you owe allegiance to certain people just because you are related by blood or law.  you are able to relate by sensing their needs, motivations, and the causes of their problems.  you are able to clarify and relate your feelings about other people, verbally or artistically. 2 represents cooperation.  it provides you with opportunities to become an organizer, facilitator, partner, and peacemaker.  you often find yourself in situations where cooperation is required.  this does not mean submitting yourself to the demands or ill-will of others.  it means operating in your own right, usually within a team or group in which everyone has a talent to contribute or role to play.  co-operation means operating together. you are here to connect other people to each other.  your friends and family are such a diverse collection of characters who may have little in common except for the bond they share with you.  you may not be the leader of the pack, but without you there to keep things connected, the pack may not be able to hold together. you may wonder, since you were born on the 2 life path of peace and understanding, why you experienced such a harsh, chaotic, or insensitive childhood.  although your efforts were visible, you may not have received recognition for your intelligence, contribution, or talent.  you probably came up with some great ideas that were discounted or put into action by someone else.  you may have found yourself seeking a position of leadership, only to realize that your ideas were too idealistic for this aggressive, judgmental world. understand and accepting your past will release you from the pain, grief, anger, fear, guilt, shame, and blame that have followed you into adulthood.  your early experiences were necessary to instill in you the desire for peace.  this acceptance may not be easy to make, and until maturity is reached, you may want to take revenge or otherwise control those involved.  but you instinctively know that forgiveness is the key.  the desire for peace, whether you can equate it to your past or not, is the driving force for all that you aspire to in life today. your position of diplomat is an important one.  you must learn to express yourself in a way that helps others to see things from other points of view.  this talent can only be accessed through developing your ability to see the merits of other views; through impartiality, broadmindedness, and patience.  true settlement means that all concerned must feel satisfied with the result.  if this is not the case, then true settlement has not occurred and someone is being forced to accept something that is unacceptable to them.  the underlying sense of loss, betrayal, and anger remains, and over time, (sometimes generations), these emotions fester until they can no longer be held in.  eventually they explode.  this is one of the principle reasons that history repeats itself, and lasting peace cannot be achieved.  this must change in the 2000s, and you are one of the people who can help change it. you must be patient and observant as you watch others achieve their results with a force that you simply do not possess.  whenever you try to imitate the aggressive tactics of others, you will end up with unnecessa
