ry problems.  other people are sometimes tempted to take credit for your ideas and efforts, to emulate your style or method, or to use you and your talents without giving due credit.  you may believe you just don’t have what it takes to enjoy the kind of success others seem to acquire with ease.  but this is a temporary situation in which you will learn what needs to be learned, and eventually emerge in your own right, with the satisfaction of knowing that your success has enabled others to succeed too. when 2s become frustrated with their slower path, they are also capable of turning diplomacy into deceit.  if you are ever caught in this maneuver, you could find yourself with the reputation of being sly or ‘two-faced’.  you can be clever at hiding the fact that your gift of persuasion has become the knack of manipulation, and rather than apologize, you can twist a situation around and make others feel guilty instead.  this is your own guilt in reverse.  it is called blame.  2s can send the rest of us on some confusing and unnecessary guilt trips. your own feelings can be easily hurt.  this need not be the case if you learn to relax with yourself.  you may want to retreat from situations in which others are insensitive, indifferent, or unkind, but in doing so, you may deprive yourself of beneficial experience.  you must learn to deal courageously and intelligently with the insensitivity of others.  you belong out there in the big bustling world, making things happen for others and for yourself. you want to be a good friend, and you need to know that you are loved.  you may give the appearance of self-confidence, but inwardly, you may be intimidated by those who seem more capable than you.  there may also be times when you question your own desirability or talent.  these are the times when your powers of persuasion become reversed, enabling others to talk you into things that go against your grain, or talk you out of things that you really want.  learn to say ‘no’ when ‘no’ is what you want to say. be careful not to give in to the pressures of others just to avoid confrontation.  your sense of self-respect must be developed so you can face life with confidence.  your strengths are often found where other people’s are lacking.  by doing for them what they cannot or will not do for themselves, in some kind of service, you will create a powerful position for yourself in which you will be considered indispensable. the magnetic pull of 2 is being felt throughout the world.  it is providing you with what you need, not only to survive the drastic changes that are occurring, but also to understand them on such a deep level that you can become constructively involved without placing yourself in dangera strong intuition is one of 2s principal gifts.  in order to hear your intuitive voice, it is necessary to feel your feelings as spontaneously as possible.  it has long been believed that intuition is a function of the mind, but this is not so.  to intuit is to ‘sense’.  to sense is to feel.  therefore, it is the power of the emotions that allows your mind to really ‘know’ something.  you are one of humanity’s ‘sensitives’, and it is so important for you to learn more about the power of our feminine emotional energy – our honesty! reduce the stress in your life.  2 is a slow-moving and gentle energy.  the pressure that comes from trying to speed things up against its deliberately slow current can make you physically, emotionally or mentally ill.  whenever you feel intolerable pressure, you are probably pushing – or being pushed – too hard. you may have a lot to do in life, but you will do it better if you proceed at a slower pace and observe the details and nuances involved.  never deny what you are feeling.  feel your feelings, understand what triggered them, and how they need to be expressed.  valuable intelligence can be gained from this ongoing experience.  it is not enough to simply acknowledge your emotions on an intellectual basis.  you must experience them.  let them pass through you and out of your physical body.  only by truly feeling your feelings will you be able to navigate the 2 path successfully. 11 gives you the power of illumination.  when you focus your special light on something or someone, it enlivens and inspires.  you then become inspired by relationships and experiences.  insight is gained when you allow yourself to see how powerful you are when it comes to connecting the right people to each other, and the right information to the right people.  your sensitivity is the basis of your intuition.  seeing the bigger picture and ‘connecting the dots’ is natural for you. you are capable of great accomplishment.  you may want to find fame and fortune.  or you may want to live comfortably and quietly in an atmosphere of love and creativity.  you may want to do something specific to change the world.  whatever your aspirations happen to be, they can only be achieved through free will.  without the freedom to create your own reality, neither love nor peace can prevail.  you are able to inspire others simply by being yourself and doing what you want to do.  you have more potential than most to learn from the drastic changes taking place on earth, and to show others the way forward – away from hatred, war, and destruction, and towards love, peace, and creativity. there can be no monopoly on something as personal as the evolution of your own soul.  for some people, life is a spiritual journey which eventually leads to the understanding of emotion.  yours is an emotional journey which will bring you deep into the spiritual and material realities of life.  some nervous tension is therefore inevitable. \at times you may not be able to understand where your power is coming from or what you are supposed to do with it.  you may question whether it is real or not, or whether you are somehow deceiving yourself.  if you back away from this exciting but demanding role, you will be dissatisfied because you will know that you are capable of so much more, frustrated with yourself for merely dreaming about what could be, instead of creating it. 11 emphasizes philosophy, science, ethics, spirituality, metaphysics, and the arts.  these areas are the most likely to provide you with the inspiration you desire.  once you are comfortable with the 11 energy, you are likely to find yourself in a position of popularity because others will be attracted to the “power” you hold, even if they are unable to pinpoint why they like you so much. 11 is called the number of fame because the people within its influence attract others to them simply by being themselves.  if you do not aspire toward fame, then at least be prepared for your fair share of “followers” or admirers. in many ways, you will become indispensable to someone – or a lot of people – and you will be amazed at the power that this position entrusts to you.  however, do not allow the needs or circumstances of others to consume your own freedom.   if you are too self-absorbed, impatient, or dictatorial, problems will follow.  allow everyone to be who and what they are – and expect the same from them in return.  try to find peace and harmony within yourself first, so that others can benefit and learn from your example.  learn to relax and be at ease with yourself, enjoy yourself, and love yourself.  be aware of everything that is going on around you, without using denial as a shield from reality.   we are living in precarious times, which are the effect of causes that must be dealt with individually and collectively.  you are likely to find yourself in “group” situations, rather than going it alone.  never doubt that you have much to offer your particular group.  if you are in a leadership position, you will need to lead by persuasion rather than force.  in fact, this is the only way you will be able to lead.  the probability, however, is that you will hold a position in life which enables someone else to lead or, better still, enables others to lead themselves.
